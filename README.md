## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A compiler/interpreter for your preferred language (e.g., Python, C++, Java, etc.)

### Cloning the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MadushanR/SortingAlgorithms.git
cd SortingAlgorithms
```

### Installing Dependencies
